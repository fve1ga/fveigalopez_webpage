We aim to quickly characterize detonation, think out of the box on how to do that. For that, we are working on:

1. Modifying the common approaches to obtain simplified chemical kinetics, by matching the steady solutions obtained for detonations with losses and detail chemistry.
2. Studying the strong influence of low temperature chemistry on DME detonations, which could mimic cool flames but for compressible flow.
3. Is it possible to rethink the way we characterize detonation cell sizes? What about surfaces instead of lengths? Do they follow any statistical law?

If you are interested on these topics or have some more ideas, [contact](#contact) me!

Keep posted for news!
