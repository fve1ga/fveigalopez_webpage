## Overview

Hydrogen is so fast and reactive that some people may consider it dangerous. Flashback happens when a flame propagates downstream the desired anchoring points and can create hazardous and unwanted situations. With our work, we want to soften the transition towards a greener society by analyzing one of the most common flame instabilities by:

1. Analyzing when does **flashback** happen given fixed burner geometry and conditions. 
2. Whenever it happens, quantify how fast the flame propagates and how dangerous it may become.

Pablo will focus on this research during her MSc Thesis.
