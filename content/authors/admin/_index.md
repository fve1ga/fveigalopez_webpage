I have been playing with fire since 2015, when I joined the aerospace combustion group at TU Delft to carry out my MSc Thesis on hydrogen burners. Amazed by the complex physics and beauty of combustion, I moved to Madrid to study the topology and stability of gaseous laminar flames in confined environments as my [PhD Thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350176792_Flame_propagation_in_narrow_channels?_sg%5B0%5D=wkQ-z2gSJWEgCqMJBT0WE-hbXBYfZDx3UNfBOs3FWL_DoSrMB06nxpN9ZXWMzBAPf_RSPCnfGH0c0gKtHYXynjEeVZt6iyieBU6WF0zv.2E8FtxIwYSraWnDK5KF_rX_M0k17N9fzMzKml7Jd0aM6Lt9rAF1f9t3LQ4oC9OMzFn3toexjnj_K8kwublHDWw) topic. The [discovery](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v13/72) of two dangerous and unknown propagation regimes for hydrogen mixtures is one of the most important accomplishments during this period. After my PhD, I expanded my research areas at CNRS-Institut Pprime, developing simplified detonation models to avoid explosions of hydrogen mixtures.

Currently, I am working on studying hydrogen addition to natural gas, from how to include and mix hydrogen to the available pipelines to the safety assessment of these blends when burning, with my focus on flashback.
