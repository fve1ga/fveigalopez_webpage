summary: We present an alternative methodology to obtain simplified chemical model by matching the steady solutions obtained with slightly-curved detonations.
abstract: 'A methodology to develop more predictive simplified kinetics schemes (1-step / 3-step chain-branching) is presented in
which D-k curves obtained with detailed kinetics are used as the fitting target aiming to capture the turning point of the
curve k,crit. This was motivated by the similar trend observed between the k,crit values and the critical reactive layer
heights for detonation propagation under yielding confinement, hcrit, determined by Taileb et al. in which simplified
kinetics fitted with conventional methods were used. Both updated schemes satisfactorily reproduce the target D − κ
curves and are are used to recompute 2D detonations propagating in channels and revise the estimated hcrit values. The
calculations show a much better agreement with the results obtained with detailed kinetics for the cell sizes and hcrit'
